### 26th December 2020 (Boxing Day)

TODAY i was super hyped for the SerialFlame virtual boxing day event.I spent most of my day talking to a bunch of random canadian people and playing grinch simulator, which, if i must say, i am GREAT at. After this, I had either a turkey or chicken curry for my afternoon snack, which I found delicious. Alright so, I was then bugged by the irritating Jenny to play more bedwars, I said yes because bedwars is the best game ever (better than grinch simulator!) (did i lie). MOVING ON. At this point, my best friend (<- he wishes) Joe got up and we played some hypixel, I was very excited to see him because Jenny had started getting annoying. Jenny won bedwars and carried the team as usual with her insane pvp skills and Joe, I guess, helped with his diamond bridging. I suck though, I bridge dumb. I had lots of fun talking to everybody on SerialLFlame, and havenâ€™t done any revision all day! (YAY) I feel very guilty about not revising though.... :))))))))))))))))))))))) no I donâ€™t. Lmao yes i do.

### 25th December 2020 (Christmas Day)

TODAY I woke up late. I opened stockings. I got bike tyres. They came in a fancy bag. Then I had a fun shower. Then I opened presents under the tree. I got a bunch of cool presents that I am very grateful for, such as clothes and money. Then I opened my tyres and struggled to put them on my bike. My thumbs went numb, (oh no) it was sad. Eventually after sweat and tears I got the tyres on my bike and I went for a quick ride. They were very nice. Unfortunately, the tyres got muddy and I will have to wash them when I get back to my house (el casa de los boffeys). IUASDHUIOAHDOADH.

### 24th December 2020 (Christmas Eve)

TODAY I woke up and didnâ€™t go the restaurant today twas so sad. (awwww). It was depressing to realise that it is no longer Lauraâ€™s birthday, however itâ€™s christmas eve today!!!!! I really like christmas eve because it means tomorrow is christmas, who wouldâ€™ve guessed. N e way, what did i do today? Glad u asked! I actually canâ€™t remember. I know that i was probably being summoned by Joe and Jenny because my g0d theyâ€™re needy and Iâ€™m just SO popular that i need to be present at all times. (u do (party emoji: ðŸŽ‰)) (especially at 11:30) i really liked staying up until 11:30 with them because i enjoy theyâ€™re company and tea cam is where itâ€™s at :D (ngl it is)(it really is!!!). I think that Joe makes the best tea because Jenny doesnâ€™t use the correct mug (top daddy!) (JOEâ€™S WAS JUST SALTY AND I KNOW THIS - imagine putting salt in tea ðŸ¤¢ JBASFBAKJ) (shush I dONâ€™T PUT SALT IN MY TEA) (smh heâ€™s lying me and JOE know just how much of a weirdo this JENNY GIRLis) Ok what now????
