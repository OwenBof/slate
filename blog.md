### 27th December 2020

TODAY is a very special day, it marks the first day which this blog will be hosted on owenboffey.com! First and foremost,,, I woke up and had to do paper round (boo). I earned a hefty Â£4.50 before returning home to join discord and see the legendary joe collyer and jenny payling. At first, I was extremely sad because Jennyp was not on discord and I had to wait until ONE PM until she got on, that was very sad and I missed her presence dearly!!!! Joe on the other hand was not missed. Becoz he woz there duh/. N E WAY!!1!??!?!?!1?!? After this, I wanted to play some minecraft with my friends but then realised that revision is MUCH more fun!. I ended up joining hypixel and playing bedwars with wumflord, moggiedoggie and the other one who was there (canâ€™t remember was it twitchnotDELUXE_?) moving on! Issariya111 sacrificed her spot for me to play and then I left half way through the game (I know Iâ€™m such a meanie!!!! FOOD FTW THO so sorry not sorry but sorry) I spent the rest of the afternoon bedwaring, death running, block partying and fountaining!!!!! (we love the fountain!) 0-0 yiss we do!!! I had to listen to a bunch of raging 15 yr olds scream over losing death run and that hurt my ears, I also learnt I have a new scream where I sound like a low-pitched tommyinnit! (jk u donâ€™t idk why u sayd that) Next, I spent time writing this blog (not my friends! me!) and then we went back to playing minecraft because Jenny insisted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOODBYEâ€¦ OH YEAH I FORGOT THAT I REVISED TODAY. I feel accomplished! Well done me!! It made me feel just like so ecstatic (big w0rds!) when the amazing Joe and Jenny crowdfunded to pay for this amazing domain name (I did pay for over half of it OK - they split the extra 18p that I provided.) (a 9p refund for both Jenny and Joe!) Ok, fr, GOODBYE NOW.

### 26th December 2020 (Boxing Day)

TODAY i was super hyped for the SerialFlame virtual boxing day event.I spent most of my day talking to a bunch of random canadian people and playing grinch simulator, which, if i must say, i am GREAT at. After this, I had either a turkey or chicken curry for my afternoon snack, which I found delicious. Alright so, I was then bugged by the irritating Jenny to play more bedwars, I said yes because bedwars is the best game ever (better than grinch simulator!) (did i lie). MOVING ON. At this point, my best friend (<- he wishes) Joe got up and we played some hypixel, I was very excited to see him because Jenny had started getting annoying. Jenny won bedwars and carried the team as usual with her insane pvp skills and Joe, I guess, helped with his diamond bridging. I suck though, I bridge dumb. I had lots of fun talking to everybody on SerialLFlame, and havenâ€™t done any revision all day! (YAY) I feel very guilty about not revising though.... :))))))))))))))))))))))) no I donâ€™t. Lmao yes i do.

### 25th December 2020 (Christmas Day)

TODAY I woke up late. I opened stockings. I got bike tyres. They came in a fancy bag. Then I had a fun shower. Then I opened presents under the tree. I got a bunch of cool presents that I am very grateful for, such as clothes and money. Then I opened my tyres and struggled to put them on my bike. My thumbs went numb, (oh no) it was sad. Eventually after sweat and tears I got the tyres on my bike and I went for a quick ride. They were very nice. Unfortunately, the tyres got muddy and I will have to wash them when I get back to my house (el casa de los boffeys). IUASDHUIOAHDOADH.

### 24th December 2020 (Christmas Eve)

TODAY I woke up and didnâ€™t go the restaurant today twas so sad. (awwww). It was depressing to realise that it is no longer Lauraâ€™s birthday, however itâ€™s christmas eve today!!!!! I really like christmas eve because it means tomorrow is christmas, who wouldâ€™ve guessed. N e way, what did i do today? Glad u asked! I actually canâ€™t remember. I know that i was probably being summoned by Joe and Jenny because my g0d theyâ€™re needy and Iâ€™m just SO popular that i need to be present at all times. (u do (party emoji: ðŸŽ‰)) (especially at 11:30) i really liked staying up until 11:30 with them because i enjoy theyâ€™re company and tea cam is where itâ€™s at :D (ngl it is)(it really is!!!). I think that Joe makes the best tea because Jenny doesnâ€™t use the correct mug (top daddy!) (JOEâ€™S WAS JUST SALTY AND I KNOW THIS - imagine putting salt in tea ðŸ¤¢ JBASFBAKJ) (shush I dONâ€™T PUT SALT IN MY TEA) (smh heâ€™s lying me and JOE know just how much of a weirdo this JENNY GIRLis) Ok what now????
